## What is copyright?

Copyright is a legal right, which protects the copyright **owner** and/or the **creator** of a work.

Copyright gives the owner **control** over their work and how it is used.

There are four areas of **intellectual property**:

  - **Copyright**: what the work is. 
  - **Patents**: how something works.
  - **Designs**: what something looks like.
  - **Trademark**: what you call it.

Works use the copyright symbol (&copy;), a name and the year of creation.

## Who owns the copyright?

There is no system in the UK for registering copyright. 

Authors automatically get copyright protection when the work is created.

Unless the work was created by an employee during their employment, or the copyright is transferred to someone else as part of their agreement. 

## What works does copyright protect?

There is no copyright protection for ideas/concepts. 

Copyright only protects  works when ideas are 
**expressed** in a form that can be reproduced or copied:

  - **Original literary**, dramatic, musical and artistic work, including illustration and photography.
  - **Original non-literary written work**, such as software, web content and databases.
  - **Sound and music** recordings.
  - **Film and television** recordings.
  - **Broadcasts**.
  - **The layout** of published editions of written, dramatic and musical works. 

## Multiple independent copyrights

The copyright in each type of work exists 
**independently**.

For example, a song may be covered by copyright:

- on the **entire collectio**n which contains the song.
- on the **lyrics** as a literary work.
- on the **music** of the song as its performance.

## How copyright protects work

Copyright prevents people from:

  - **copying** work
  - putting someone's work on the **Internet**.
  - **distributing** copies of someone's work, whether free of     
  charge or for sale    
  - **renting** or **lending** copies of someone's work
  - making an **adaptation** of someone's work
  - **performing**, **showing** or **playing** someone's work in public

There are certain [exceptions](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/exceptions-to-copyright), 
especially in the case of photographs, 
films and recorded sound.

For example:
- making contentaccessible for disabled people.
- text and data mining for research.
- teaching, fair dealing and more.

## Copyright duration

Copyright protection starts as soon 
as a work is created. 

After copyright expires, 
the work is in the **public domain** 
so anyone can use or copy the works.

|  Type of work   | How long copyright usually last         |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| Written, dramatic, musical and artistic work      | 70 years after the author's death    |
| Sound and music recording    | 70 years from when it's first published    |
| Films    | 70 years after the death of the director, screenplay author and composer   |
| Broadcasts    | 50 years from when it's first broadcast    |
| Layout of published editions of written, dramatic or musical works    | 25 years from when it's first published    |

## Copyright owner: employees, freelancers and commissions

The copyright is an automatic right and 
does not need to be registered 
or paid for (by its owner).

The first owner of copyright 
will normally be the **author**
(who created the work).

An **employer** is usually the 
first owner of copyright in work which 
is made in the course of an **author's** 
employment under a contract. 

For **commissioned work** and **freelancers**, the copyright 
usually lies with the **person who creates 
the work** unless
it is specified in the contract. Hence, it is 
important when commissioning work 
to put an agreement in place first 
covering the intellectual property of the 
resulting work.   

## Copyright of images in the UK

Photographs, illustrations and other 
images will generally be protected by 
copyright as **artistic works**.

The copyright owner of a photograph
is its **creator**, for example, 
the photographer or the 
organisation/employer with which 
the photographer has a contractual agreement.

The creator of an image may choose to allow 
a person or organisation to **license**
the work on their behalf, license the copyright 
directly themselves, or “assign” (transfer) 
the copyright to another person.

Copyright in images lasts for the 
**life of the creator plus 70 years** 
from the end of the calendar year 
of their death. 

Hence, the length 
of the copyright period will 
depend on when the image was created. 

Images created < 70 years ago = still in copyright
Images created > 70 years ago = copyright 
depends on whether and when the creator died


## Digital images in copyright law

Digital images covered by copyright 
protection include:

- Digital photos taken on mobile phones 
and digital cameras.
- Images that were first generated on 
photographic film and any digital images 
created from them.
- Images such as diagrams and illustrations.

**NOTE** that **creating a copy of an image**, such as
a painting, won't result in a new copyright 
in the new item. 

There is some uncertainty regarding whether 
copyright can exist in **digitised images** 
of older works (e.g. a painting or
manuscript) for which copyright has expired.

Some argue that a new copyright may arise in such copies if **specialist skills** have been used to optimise details (i.e. retouching images).

Uncertainty is due that according to established case law, 
copyright can only subsist in subject 
matter that is original in the sense that 
it is the author's own **‘intellectual creation'**.




## Using copyrighted work

To use something protected by copyright 
these are the options that someone has:

1. Agree a licence with the owner to use it:
  - find owner - in many cases it might not be how
  holds the content
  - agree a licence agreement (permission about format, extent, purpose and time of use)
respect moral rights (attribution right, right of integrity, right to object to false attribution)
2. Buy or acquire the copyright
3. Confirm that your intended use falls 
within the exceptions to copyright.






Some types of licences
➤ Licences are contractual agreements between the copyright owner/s and user/s limiting how the work can be used. Examples of licences are:
Jisc Collections
Blanket licences (by a collecting society, e.g. CLA)
Open educational resources (OERs, e.g. usually Creative Commons)
Creative Commons
Orphan works

Creative Commons Licenses
CC is a standardized way to grant copyright permissions to creative work by individuals, organisations and institutions.
CC help creators to retain copyright while allowing others to copy, distribute, and make some uses of their work.
CC licenses work around the world and last as long as applicable copyright lasts (because they are built on copyright).
CC common features serve as baseline, on top of which licensors can choose to grant additional permissions.
CC licenses do not affect freedoms that the law grants to users of creative works otherwise protected by copyright, such as exceptions and limitations, such as fair dealing.

Database rights
An electronic database may be protected by copyright and database rights.
Database rights will cover a collection of copyrighted works.
Permission must have been obtained from the copyright holders for the use of their work.
Database rights are automatic and have no registration forms or fees and give the owner total control over their work. You can use, sell or lease it to a third party.
Database rights last for 15 years from creation, but if published during this time the term is 15 years from publication.   


## Excercise: Curating a multi-dimensional dataset for storytelling (Nicola)

In teams of 2-3 curate a dataset. Focus on gather content beyond images, look for 
video and 3D

Pay attention of advice for images, videos and 3D models.

Pay attention to filenames.

Check for copyright 



## Storytelling with multi-dimensional data


A variety of storytelling tools:

- Storytelling tools: [TimeMapper from Open Knowledge Foundation Labs]( https://timemapper.okfnlabs.org/)
- [Meet StoryMaps](https://storymaps.com/)

This is a lesson created via The Carpentries Workbench. It is written in
[Pandoc-flavored Markdown][pandoc] for static files (with extension `.md`) and
[R Markdown][r-markdown] for dynamic files that can render code into output
(with extension `.Rmd`). Please refer to the [Introduction to The Carpentries
Workbench][carpentries-workbench] for full documentation.


:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: instructor

Inline instructor notes can help inform instructors of timing challenges
associated with the lessons. They appear in the "Instructor View"

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge 

## Challenge 1: Can you do it?

What is the output of this command?

```r
paste("This", "new", "lesson", "looks", "good")
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution 

## Output
 
```output
[1] "This new lesson looks good"
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::


## Challenge 2: how do you nest solutions within challenge blocks?

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution 

You can add a line with at least three colons and a `solution` tag.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Figures

You can include figures generated from R Markdown:

```{r pyramid, fig.alt = "pie chart illusion of a pyramid", fig.cap = "Sun arise each and every morning"}
pie(
  c(Sky = 78, "Sunny side of pyramid" = 17, "Shady side of pyramid" = 5), 
  init.angle = 315, 
  col = c("deepskyblue", "yellow", "yellow3"), 
  border = FALSE
)
```
Or you can use pandoc markdown for static figures with the following syntax:

`![optional caption that appears below the figure](figure url){alt='alt text for
accessibility purposes'}`

## Math

One of our episodes contains $\LaTeX$ equations when describing how to create
dynamic reports with {knitr}, so we now use mathjax to describe this:

`$\alpha = \dfrac{1}{(1 - \beta)^2}$` becomes: $\alpha = \dfrac{1}{(1 - \beta)^2}$

Cool, right?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints 

- Use `.md` files for episodes when you want static content
- Use `.Rmd` files for episodes when you need to generate output
- Run `sandpaper::check_lesson()` to identify any issues with your lesson
- Run `sandpaper::build_lesson()` to preview your lesson locally
