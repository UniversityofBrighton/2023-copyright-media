## Using copyrighted work

To use something protected by copyright 
these are the options that someone has:

1. Agree a licence with the owner to use it:
  - find owner - in many cases it might not be how
  holds the content
  - agree a licence agreement (permission about format, extent, purpose and time of use)
respect moral rights (attribution right, right of integrity, right to object to false attribution)
2. Buy or acquire the copyright
3. Confirm that your intended use falls 
within the exceptions to copyright.

## Licensing copyrighted work
Licences are **contractual agreements** between the 
copyright owner/s and user/s limiting how the work can be used. 

[Examples of licences](https://www.jisc.ac.uk/guides/copyright-law/licences) are:

- [Jisc Model Licence](https://subscriptionsmanager.jisc.ac.uk/about/jisc-model-licence)
- Copyright owners can be represented by a collecting society who
negotiates licenses with users, e.g. (Spotify)[https://www.spotify.com/uk/legal/spotify-for-artists-terms-and-conditions/], [CLA](https://www.cla.co.uk)
- [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/cclicenses/)

Creative Works where a copyright owner is unknown or untraceable are known
as **Orphan Works**. Guidance on how to deal with this cases is available from the
[UK government](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/copyright-orphan-works).

## Creative Commons Licenses (CC)

Creative Commons licenses are a **standardised way to grant copyright permissions** 
to creative work by individuals, 
organisations and institutions.

They  help creators to **retain copyright** 
while allowing others to **copy, distribute, and make some uses** 
of their work.

They are designed to be easy to use and understand by stating
in simple terms what the user is allowed to do, and under
which conditions.

They all have common **features** which serve as baseline. 
On top of which licensors can choose to grant additional permissions.
